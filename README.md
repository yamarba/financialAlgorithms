# financialAlgorithms

These projects are based on algorithmic trading projects by Software Developer Nick McCullum. He has some great free courses and others not so free. 
My interest in Finance led me to his courses. It's a great resource. I found the API calls to the IEX exchange highly educational. As well as common 
challenges when making these calls. I followed along the projects and included much of my own notes.
